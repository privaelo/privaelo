# Hi, I'm Tagnon Okoumassoun

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** focused on building practical ML pipelines and research-driven prototypes that solve real-world problems.

## Projects
- **[nc_stream](https://github.com/privaelo/nc_stream)** – Python package for streaming .cdf files from **Satellite data** directly from AWS S3 using `xarray` + `h5netcdf`. Designed for reproducible geospatial ML workflows and large-scale anomaly detection.  
- **Engine Sensor Anomaly Detection Pipeline** – Applied **sliding-window feature extraction** + **Isolation Forest** to detect abnormal sensor trends, with correlation analysis and visual dashboards for root-cause insights.  
- **GeoWarn** – A cloud-native ML platform for **geospatial anomaly detection**, integrating satellite + ground sensor data streams. Building with AWS, FastAPI, Kubernetes, MLflow, and Terraform.

## Skills
- **Languages**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, Bash  
- **MLOps**: MLflow, DVC, Docker, FastAPI, Kubernetes, Terraform  
- **Cloud**: AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, S3, BigQuery  
- **Specialties**: Anomaly detection, computer vision, geospatial AI, scalable pipelines

## Focus
- Designing and training ML models from scratch  
- Deploying models as APIs or pipelines with **MLOps best practices**  
- Optimizing ML workflows for **scalability, reproducibility, and impact**
